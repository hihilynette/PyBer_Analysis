# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
This project provides a exploratory analysis on the python based ride-sharing app company by using pandas library, jupyter notebook and Matplotlib. Th analysis of the visualization helps PyBer to improve the ride-sharing services and to determine the affordability under the certain neighborhoods.

## Results
Below is the PyBer summary among 3 types of cityes.

Analysis from the summary:

1. Urban cities have the top amount of rides and drivers, which lead to the lowest averga fare per ride and driver.
2. On the oppiste, due to the lack of drivers for rural areas, the avrage fare per ride and per driver is extremely expensive. It is almost 1.5 over the results from Urban cities. 
3. Suburban has a medium numbers comparing to rural and urban cities. 
4. We can tell that the average fare per ride and per driver have close connections to the number of total drivers in the area. Fares are cheaper when the area has more drivers.

Below is the mltiple-line graph for the period from Jan 1, 2019 - Apr 28, 2019

Analysis from the graph:

1. It's not surprised to see that urban city has the highest total fares comparing with the rest two.
2. Late February tends to have a peak point of rides for all 3 types of city, while early March has the lowest amount of total fares.

## Summary

There is a potential growth for the company in the suburban and rural areas by increasing the number of drivers. More drivers can directly lead to more rides sharing, which can bring a higher level of the revenue.
